## Why This Architecture?

- **Next.js App Router**: Simplifies routing, layouts, and API route co-location. Great for performance and future SSR.
- **API Proxy (Backend for Frontend)**: Prevents API key exposure on the client side and enables centralized error handling and caching logic.
- **Modular Design**: Components are reusable, small in scope, and easy to test/maintain.
- **Mobile-first + TailwindCSS**: Guarantees responsiveness from the start.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keeps the bundle small, aiding performance and maintainability.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

The app follows a clean, modular structure using **Next.js App Router** with API routes for secure backend proxying.

### Key Decisions:

- **API Key Security**: CoinMarketCap API is accessed via serverless API routes in `/app/api/` to prevent exposing the key.
- **Performance**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind ensures speed and responsiveness.
- **Scalability**: Component-driven UI with reusable logic and clear state management.
- **Maintainability**: Logic is separated into hooks, utils, and components for clean and extendable code.

## Animations

- **CSS-based skeleton loader** for table loading
- Hover transitions for table rows and converter form
- Toast notifications for errors and conversions
